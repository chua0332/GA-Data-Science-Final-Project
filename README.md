# GA-Data-Science-Final-Project

In this project, I will be evaluating a number of machine learning algorithms to predict the fair value of the REIT's properties by aiming to minimise MAE below a certain threshold level.The rationale for doing this is to reduce the reliance of property valuers whose predictions may be way off occasionally.

A variety of algorithms were explored, ranging from regularized regressions to ensemble based methods such as Random forest. Through some hyperparameters tuning, I was able to achieve a MAE of approximately 76K using the Random Forest algorithm.
